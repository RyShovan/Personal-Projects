## Arbitrary Question Number Generator

This python script will help you to generate the required number of questions in a specific range of question numbers.

Suppose you want to solve math problems from a chapter. That chapter has 235 questions, but you don't have that much time to solve all the questions. So, you want to pick 40 questions randomly out of that 235 questions. This script will help you to choose that 40 questions.

This script is written on Python 3. So your system must have installed Python 3 on it.

If you want to try this script temporarily in your Linux system, run this command in terminal.
